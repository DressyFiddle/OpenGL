This is a way for fast implementation and deployment of Imgui / Opengl using VSCode.
Provided are a few tasks which can be run in vscode (compiled exe will be in root of the project).
Compiler used is declared in tasks, but for simplicity you should have Mingw32 instaled on your machine.
The default location should be C:\\MinGW\\bin\\ and same should be added to system variables path on your 
machine.

If the setup of your compiler was successful, you should be able to compile all test cases without any issue.
Same can be used along with online docs to expand and add features.

TO-DO:
    1.Add modules
    2.Dynamic loader
    3.CMake build

Further information will be added here.
